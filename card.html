			<p class="font-family font-style">The peregrine falcon, also known as
				the peregrine, and historically as the duck hawk in North America, is
				a widespread bird of prey in the family Falconidae.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="font-family"><span>Scientific Name</span>: Falco peregrinus</li>
				<li class="font-family"><span>Wing Span</span>: 2.4 â€“ 3.9 ft. </li>
				<li class="font-family"><span>Speed</span>: 240 mph</li>
				<li class="font-family"><span>Conservation Status</span>: Least Concern</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="font-family">The peregrine falcon lives mostly along mountain
				ranges, river valleys, coastlines, and increasingly in cities. In
				mild-winter regions, it is usually a permanent resident, and some
				individuals, especially adult males, will remain on the breeding
				territory. Only populations that breed in Arctic climates typically
				migrate great distances during the northern winter.</p>
